# The application has all the nessecery calculations related to Laser Safety
# with full explanation for the given equations.

# Features:
[^1]Imported HTML and CSS in order the webpage to has clean and esthetic look.
[^2]Contact form for future collaboration and questions.(Used https://formsubmit.co/?utm_source=formsubmit.co&utm_medium=site%20link&utm_campaign=submission%20page service for the task)
[^3]Diffrent levels (Menu) of the application give the possibility of the user to have maximum
simplified user interface.
[^4]Visual effect: Added lottie-files - small - json animations

# Future ideas:
[^6]Counter of the calculations 
[^7]Add more detailed info about other aspects of Laser Safety and its importance.
[^8]Change the topic and tittle of the web-page add more information about Laser Technologies in general.
[^9]Calculations about exaust system 
[^10]Graphs linked directly to optimizing the process of laser cutting and laser marking.
[^11]Inovations in laser technologies 
[^12]Intresting facts about lasers.
