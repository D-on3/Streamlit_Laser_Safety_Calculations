# The application has all the nessecery calculations related to Laser Safety
# with full explanation for the given equations.

# Features:
-Imported HTML and CSS in order the webpage to has clean and esthetic look.
-Contact form for future collaboration and questions.(Used https://formsubmit.co/?utm_source=formsubmit.co&utm_medium=site%20link&utm_campaign=submission%20page service for the task)

# Future ideas:
-Counter of the calculations 
-Add more detailed info about other aspects of Laser Safety and its importance.
-Change the topic and tittle of the web-page add more information about Laser Technologies in general.
-Calculations about exaust system 
-Graphs linked directly to optimizing the process of laser cutting and laser marking.
-Inovations in laser technologies 
- Intresting facts about lasers.
- Additive manifacturing and metal 3d printing 

# ToDo:
