# Future ideas:
-Counter of the calculations 
-Add more detailed info about other aspects of Laser Safety and its importance.
-Change the topic and tittle of the web-page add more information about Laser Technologies in general.
-Calculations about exaust system 
-Graphs linked directly to optimizing the process of laser cutting and laser marking.
-Inovations in laser technologies 
- Intresting facts about lasers.
